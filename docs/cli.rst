Tibanna Deployment
++++++++++++++++++

::

    tibanna deploy_unicorn [options]


::

    tibanna_4dn deploy_pony [options]


::

    tibanna_cgap deploy_zebra [options]



The above three are *not* interchangeable and each should be used to deploy a tibanna stepfunction of its own kind.

Even for deploying a single lambda function, we should use the right entry point as below.


::

    tibanna deploy_core -n <lambda_name> [options]


::

    tibanna_4dn deploy_core -n <lambda_name> [options]


::

    tibanna_cgap deploy_core -n <lambda_name> [options]




Running Workflow
++++++++++++++++

::

    tibanna run_workflow -i <input_json> --sfn=<stepfunctionname>


::

    tibanna_4dn run_workflow -i <input_json> --sfn=<stepfunctionname>


::

    tibanna_cgap run_workflow -i <input_json> --sfn=<stepfunctionname>



The above three can be used interchageably, as long as the correct step function name is used. i.e. the following command still works and would submit a job to ``tibanna_pony`` even if the entry point ``tibanna_cgap`` was used.


::

    tibanna_cgap run_workflow -i <input_json> --sfn=tibanna_pony
