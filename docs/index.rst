Tibanna_ff is an extension of Tibanna that integrates with 4DN/CGAP data portals. Tibanna is a software tool that helps you run genomic pipelines on the the Amazon (AWS) cloud. Tibanna_ff does the same but in integration with 4DN/CGAP data portal.

From Tibanna ``0.9.8`` (also ``tibanna_ff`` ``0.9.8``), Tibanna_ff is no longer part of the ``tibanna`` package, but is released as a separate package that requires ``tibanna`` as dependency.
